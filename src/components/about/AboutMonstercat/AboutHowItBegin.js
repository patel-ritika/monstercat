					<h1>HOW IT BEGAN</h1>
					<p>
						In 2011, co-founders Mike Darlington and Ari Paunonen met at the
						University of Waterloo, connecting over their shared love of music
						and entrepreneurial spirit. Noticing the steady rise of video
						platforms like YouTube, as well as the booming electronic music
						scene at the time, Mike and Ari set out to launch a boundary-pushing
						digital record label that would deliver high-quality, accessible
						electronic music. With community at the core, they built a
						tight-knit family of passionate artists, global music fans, avid
						gamers, and content creators, that came to be known as Monstercat.
