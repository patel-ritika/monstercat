					<h2>What We Do</h2>
					<p>
						Championing a cadre of world-renowned artists, Monstercat exceeds
						200 million global audio streams monthly. With six releases a week
						across its Uncaged, Instinct, and Silk brands, Monstercat has topped
						radio and streaming charts worldwide, offering a diverse range of
						genres across bass, dance, pop, house, chill, and electronic.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to its genre-diverse music offerings, Monstercat is
						known for its non-exclusive record deals which allow artists
						flexibility and creative freedom. To further its mission of artist
						sustainability, the label adheres to a 50⁄50 split model, ensuring
						artists royalty payments monthly so they can work towards making a
						living off their music and art.
					</p>
					<p>
						Beyond recorded music, Monstercat channels the undeniable power of
						its brand into apparel, live events, gaming partnerships, and sync
						deals. Spanning over 100 events across 16 countries, Monstercat has
						hosted stages and shows at notable international festivals including
						Tomorrowland, Amsterdam Dance Event, and Miami Music Week. The label
						also throws its own homegrown festival, Compound, which draws
						thousands of fans to Vancouver in celebration of community, music,
						art, and more.
					</p>

					<p>
						Monstercat’s live radio program ‘Call of the Wild’ boosts the signal
						even further, reaching millions of listeners weekly through its
						syndication partnerships across 30+ global networks, including
						SiriusXM and leading livestreaming platform Twitch. In 2021, the
						Monstercat Silk Showcase entered the fold, which features mixes from
						a rotating cast of artists across progressive & deep house,
						chillout, trance, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2020, Monstercat launched the original entertainment series,
						mctv, which serves as a global discovery hub for fans and a
						performance opportunity for artists on Monstercat’s leading Twitch
						channel.
					</p>
					<p>
						Within the work of sync and partnerships, Monstercat has redefined
						music licensing for content creators and major brands. Undertaking
						co-branded soundtracks, in-game activations, and collaborations with
						game publishers and titles including Epic/Psyonix (Fortnite, Rocket
						League), Roblox, Hi-Rez Studios (SMITE), Amanotes, and Beat Games
						(Beat Saber), Monstercat offers curated solutions that continue to
						excite and fuel the gaming community. Additionally, Monstercat
						supports content creators with its music licensing program,
						Monstercat Gold, which allows creators to choose from thousands of
						songs in the label’s ever-growing library for claim-free use in
						livestream and video content.
