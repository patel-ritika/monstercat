			<h2>Diversity & Inclusion Statement</h2>
			<div className="diversity-content">
				<p>
					Monstercat’s vision is to become the world’s most innovative music
					company, leading the movement towards artist sustainability. Our team
					upholds the values of Community (bringing people together), Curiosity
					(the constant pursuit of knowledge), Integrity (being true to one’s
					word), and Tenacity (to believe in one’s self).
				</p>
				<p>
					In line with these values, Monstercat is committed to supporting the
					movement towards equity, diversity, and inclusion within our company
					and the local communities in which we operate. Following an internal
					audit by People & Culture with support from domain expert consultants,
					Monstercat’s goal over the next year is to achieve level 3 on the
					Global Diversity & Inclusion Benchmarks (GDIB). We aim to achieve this
					by adopting the following practices:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Corporate policy improvements</li>
					<li>Education and awareness for staff</li>
					<li>Management training & development</li>
					<li>Mobilising a D&I Task Force</li>
					<li>Corporate social responsibility initiatives</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					These efforts are ongoing - assessing our goals, objectives,
					strategies, resource needs and practices every year to purposefully
					embed D&I within Monstercat’s business strategy.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a company, we always strive to learn more and do better. We
					recognize that in this process, challenges, obstacles, and mistakes
					are inevitable, so we welcome feedback and collaboration from all
					communities as we build a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive
					culture.
				</p>
				<p>
					For any further inquiries about our goals, strategies, initiatives or
					partnership opportunities, please contact our People & Culture team at
					hr@monstercat.com
				</p>
				<p>
					Warm regards,
					<br />
					Monstercat
